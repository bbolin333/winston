        Winston was adopted from the humane society in Phoenix Arizona. We have
        been together for many years now and have had lots of adventures. He
        will always be my best friend.

        Winston has two sibilings: Lowen and Kitten.
        He is moody but he loves them both dearly.
        He is a bit of a mama's boy but he ain't no wimp.
        He has a girlfriend Rose (aka Rosie). He lets her come 
        near him when he eats and even lets her snuggle up when 
        he is sitting with his mom.
